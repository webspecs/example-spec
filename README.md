# WebSpec Example

This repository is meant to evolve into a permanent example of how a WebSpec is made. Before that,
though, it is used primarily as a an area in which to develop this specification style.

## Files

* `index.bs`: This is the Bikeshed source.
* `index.html`: The generated HTML. You can edit that if you really want to, but it will get 
overwritten.
* `run.sh`: A small script that runs the generator, **assuming** you've checked out
  [our own fork of Bikeshed](/webspecs/bikeshed).
